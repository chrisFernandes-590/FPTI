# Personal Finance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a simple **command-line personal finance dashboard** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It helps you visualize and track key financial metrics by analyzing your **transaction history**, **net worth over time**, and **investment portfolio**.  
The application is designed to be interactive and is fully powered by the data you upload.

The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

1. **Transactions & Cash Flow** – Analyze your income and expenses to visualize your monthly cash flow.  
2. **Net Worth Over Time** – Track your net worth trend and see your progress toward financial goals.  
3. **Investment Portfolio** – View your investment holdings and calculate their current market value (mock stock prices).
